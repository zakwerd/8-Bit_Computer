# Designing and Building an 8-Bit Computer from Scratch (2020)
*Zakary Werdegar*

## Overview
I recently took a class that went into detail as to how machine code and assembly language is used. As one who loves electrical engineering, building a computer from scratch has always been something on my mind. I think I've reached a point in which I can now take on this project while being challenged but not totally confused as to what I'm doing. From understanding various electrical components in a greater depth to having a more rigorous understanding of how computers operate and interpret code, I think this project will provide a lot of knowledge and benefit.

This project was inspired by [Ben Eater's 8-Bit computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCbAafKLqC8&t=929s&ab_channel=BenEater) that I came across on YouTube. Ben provides amazing, high-quality videos that explain nearly every detail of how his computer operates. I will undoubtably be consulting Ben's channel for inspiration and insight, but I hope to produce a computer that is uniquely mine. For anyone interested in learning more about this topic, please visit [Ben's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA). It is one of the greatest engineering channels I've come across.
