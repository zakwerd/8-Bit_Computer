# 8-Bit Computer Clock Overview

## Overview
The computer clock regulates the speed at which the computer's operations occur (rate at which assembly instructions are enacted). By having a slow computer clock, this will enable us to watch as the computer operates and follow its operations' paths. The computer clock's core will be an adjustable, astable 555 timer.

## Part 1 - Astable 555 Timer
The main component of the clock will be a 555 timer chip running on astable mode with a potentiometer to adjust the frequency.
